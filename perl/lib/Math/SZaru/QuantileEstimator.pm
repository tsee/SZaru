=head1 NAME

Math::SZaru::QuantileEstimator - Quantile estimation based on Munro-Paterson algorithm

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Math::SZaru::QuantileEstimator;
  my $ue = Math::SZaru::QuantileEstimator->new($maxelems);
  $ue->add_elem("foo");
  # add many more elems using add_elem ...
  my $inserted_elems_count = $ue->tot_elems;
  my $estimated_unique_count = $ue->estimate();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Math::SZaru::QuantileEstimator> provides a statistical estimate of
quantiles in a large data set (or stream). It uses the algorithm published
by Munro and Paterson:
I<Munro & Paterson, "Selection and Sorting with Limited Storage", Theoretical Computer Science, Vol 12, p 315-323, 1980>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Constructor. Expects an integer indicating the number of quantiles to calculate.
In a nutshell, passing 101 will mean that the return value of the C<estimate>
call (see below) will return a list of min, 1st-percentile, 2nd-percentile, ...,
99th-percentile, max (min + 100 = 101). Other values cause the space between min
and max to be differently divided. Asking for only two quantiles will just yield
min/max to be tracked. Asking for three quantiles will add the median (50th percentile).

=head2 add_elem

Given a floating point number, adds the number to the QuantileEstimator.

=head2 add_elems

Same as C<add_elem>, but accepts an arbitrary list of numbers to
insert into the estimator at once.

=head2 tot_elems

Returns the total count of the number of elements that were
added to the estimator.

=head2 estimate

Returns the estimated quantiles in a reference to an array
as described in the C<new> documentation above.
